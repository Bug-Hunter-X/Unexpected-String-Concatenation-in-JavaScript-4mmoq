This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript stemming from its dynamic typing system.  The function `foo` intends to add two numbers. However, when one argument is a string, JavaScript performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition, producing an unexpected result. The solution showcases how type checking can prevent this issue.
